GUIDING QUESTION:

You have probably used the MTRâ€™s trip planner (https://www.mtr.com.hk/en/customer/jp2/) to 
get around Hong Kong. After we enter the origin and destination stations, the software calculates
all the different options for the journey and tells us the quickest and alternative options.
Whenever there are multiple routes,such as in a big city with complex transit network like Hong
Kong, this leads to a great number of possible options and therefore a computationally expensive
task.
In this assignment you are going to code a simplified travel planner for the MTR sub-network using 
the knowledge you have learnt.
